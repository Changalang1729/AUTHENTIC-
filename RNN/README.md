In this file, we will see the RNN, the pre_processor to clean up the data and the tf vectors, the glove_similarity to compare the corpus to current articles. 

1) pre_processor (jupyter notebook): cleans up the whole file to lower the dataset and make sure that the dataset has no variable length
2) fixedRNN (jupyter notebook): generates the RNN from an input corpus, or multiple is possible as well
3) glove_similarity (jupyter notebook): utilizes the cosin similarity + glove vectorization from google in order to compare similarity in sentiment
