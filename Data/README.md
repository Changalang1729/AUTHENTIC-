The data set we have used contains various articles from a variety of sources. Information about the data set can be found 
in the pdf.

The data set contained ~80,000 different texts, and for our neural network we used ~13,000 right- and left-leaning articles.

Also contained in this folder is the script I used to take the data I needed from the large group of data and the script I 
used to preprocess it for the neural net.

The preprocessor is the initial one I used, and the pretty_preprocessor is the fixed version the Eric made to work better with
his neural net (and give more information to us).
