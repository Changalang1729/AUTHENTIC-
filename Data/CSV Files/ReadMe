The CSV files are too big to upload to this GitHub respository. I have included a link to the csv files used to train the 
neural network.

Each csv file contains text of all the articles used (~12000 articles per bias) in one giant text file. If you want to 
create the individual files yourself (it crashed my browser when I tried to upload them to Google Drive), you can do so using
the data set and the parser I made. Some sites were also taken from the web using the web scraper.

The link to the csv files is down here:

These files were processed using all of the processing tools from the neural network.
